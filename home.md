## ✈️ Brian Leonard

**Principal Solutions Architect | IFR-Rated Cirrus Pilot | Workflow Optimizer**

I modernize legacy systems, streamline technical workflows, and fly smarter skies. Whether I’m refining cockpit automation or architecting GenAI-enabled tools, I bring precision, warmth, and a systems-thinking mindset to every challenge.

## 🔧 What I Do

- **Legacy Modernization**: Transforming outdated systems into scalable, secure platforms.
- **GenAI Integration**: Designing tools that blend automation with human insight.
- **Aviation Ops**: Hands-on with flight planning, weather analysis, and CSIP outreach.
- **Workflow Design**: From irrigation to IT, I build modular systems that work.

## 🛩️ Flight Ops & Papa Patrol
